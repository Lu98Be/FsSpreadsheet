Files found here follow the following rules:

- Files starting with **WRITE_** are created by tests. 
- Other files should not be deleted or opened/saved to avoid corrupting tests.

> Never open these test files and save them with libre office or microsoft excel. They will automatically standardize the files to their favored format, making them all uniform and working with both OpenXml and Exceljs.
